# ArduDisco
"Disco lights" using an Arduino (Uno in my case), a NeoPixel compatible LED strip and a IR remote.

If you want to use it - do it. If you don't, then don't.
Change everything as you might need to get it work.


If you have any ideas on how to improove my code i'd really appreciate your ideas. :)


# Credits
The main code for the "disco" effects is forked from https://github.com/bartlettmic/SparkFun-RGB-LED-Music-Sound-Visualizer-Arduino-Code.
I used cyborg5's IRLib2 as infrared recieving library from https://github.com/cyborg5/IRLib2 and Adafruit_NeoPixel as LED library which can be found at https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel.
