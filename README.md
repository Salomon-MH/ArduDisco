# ArduDisco - [DJ0.DE](https://dj0.de)
"Disco lights" using an Arduino (Uno in my case) or two of them, a NeoPixel compatible LED strip and a IR remote.

# How?
I managed to get it work using a "dirty hack" for a single Arduino setup, you have to press your IR button twice though.
The dual Arduino setup should be more reliable and without any twice-clicking required.

# Can I use it?
Please ask for permission first and always name the source.
Especially distributing the software as your own or using it for commercial purposes is strongly forbidden.

If you have any ideas on how to improove my code i'd really appreciate your ideas. :)


# Credits
I used [cyborg5's IRLib2](https://github.com/cyborg5/IRLib2) as infrared recieving library and [Adafruit_NeoPixel](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel) as LED library.
The basic code for some of the "disco" effects is forked from [SparkFun's RGB LED Music Sound Visualizer Arduino Code](https://github.com/bartlettmic/SparkFun-RGB-LED-Music-Sound-Visualizer-Arduino-Code).
