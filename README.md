# ArduDisco - [DJ0.DE](https://dj0.de)
"Disco lights" using an Arduino (Uno in my case) or two of them, a NeoPixel compatible LED strip and a IR remote.

# How?
I managed to get it work using a "dirty hack" for a single Arduino setup, you have to press your IR button twice though.
The dual Arduino setup should be more reliable and without any twice-clicking required.

# Can I use it?
Please ask for permission first and always name the source.
Especially distributing the software as your own or using it for commercial purposes is strongly forbidden.

If you have any ideas on how to improove my code i'd really appreciate your ideas. :)


# Credits
I used cyborg5's IRLib2 as infrared recieving library from https://github.com/cyborg5/IRLib2 and Adafruit_NeoPixel as LED library which can be found at https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel.
The basic code for some of the "disco" effects is forked from https://github.com/bartlettmic/SparkFun-RGB-LED-Music-Sound-Visualizer-Arduino-Code.
